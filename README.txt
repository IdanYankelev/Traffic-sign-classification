Hey, thanks for the fun project.

I have split my code to 2 parts to ease testing the model performance.

The code for training the classification model is in train_model.py
and the code for testing and generating the results is in test_model.py .

You can test the model without re-training by loading the my_model.h5 file.

To reduce zip size I will not add the dataset, however I have used the dataset in the reference link you attached for this assignment
